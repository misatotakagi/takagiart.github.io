	THIS PIECE WAS COMPLETELY OUT-OF-THE-BLUE, UNEXPECTED, AND UNCOMPLETED FOT THE LONGEST TIME. SHE STAYED AS A ROUGH DRAFT FOR THE LONGEST TIME I COULD REMEMBER, AND ONE DAY I JUST PICKED UP WHERE I LEFT OFF AND FINISHED IT. SHE DOESN'T PORTRAY THE MOST VIBRANT EXPRESSION, OR WEAR COLORS THAT CATCH YOUR EYE. INSTEAD I WANTED TO SHIFT THE AUDIENCE'S ATTENTION TOWARDS THE BACKGROUND LEAVES AND HER HAIR COLOR. IT WAS REALLY FUN TO WORK WITH QUIET, YET BRIGHT COLORS AND BACKGROUND ILLUSTRATIONS.
