	THIS ART IS VERY CONTRASTING TO OTHER ARTS THAT I HAVE CREATED, IN THE SENSE OF THEME-WISE. THIS PIECE ENDED UP BEING VERY PASTEL, SOFT AND BUBBLY, WHICH IS COMPLETELY UNEXPECTING OF MY ART STYLE. HOWEVER I WANTED TO SHOW VARIETY OF WHAT I CAN DO AS AN ARTIST. I REALLY ENJOYED CREATING HER, WITH HER DOLL-LIKE EYES AND BOLD LIPS. I CHOSE NOT TO ADD ANY SHADOWS OR DETAILS TO THIS PIECE BECAUSE I WANTED IT TO REMIND THE AUDIENCE OF 80'S CARTOON STYLE.
