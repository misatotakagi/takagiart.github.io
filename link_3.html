	MEDIUM: IPHONE, PREMIERE PRO, AFTER EFFECTS
<br>
<br>
	THIS PIECE WAS MADE WITH ONLY SCRAPS OF VIDEOS FOUND ON MY IPHONE, THEN ROUGHLY PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE A MONTAGE. IPHONES HAVE A FUNCTION WHERE IT AUTOMATICALLY RECORDS 3 SECOND CLIP OF THE SCENE BEFORE THE PICTURE IS TAKEN. I COMBINED SEVERAL CLIPS TAKEN FROM DISNEY WORLD ON PREMIERE PRO AND EXPORTED IT TO AFTER EFFECTS. ON THE AFTER EFFECTS, I ADDED WHITE LINE DRAWINGS ONTO EVERY SINGLE FRAMES IN ORDER TO CREATE A SIMPLE ANIMATION.
