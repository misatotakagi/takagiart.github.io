	I WAS SCROLLING THROUGH TWITTER AND I FOUND A PHOTOGRAPHY OF A JAPANESE "YANKEE" IN HER HEELS SQUATTING DOWN. IN JAPAN, A YANKEE IS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL A DELINQUENT. THEY'RE SHAMED FOR THEIR LIFESTYLE, OR WHAT THEY PUT ON THEMSELVES (TATTOOS, FASHION, WEAPONS). THE TITLE IS BASED ON A COMMENT THAT WAS POSTED UNDER THE PICTURE, CRITICIZING THEIR LIFESTYLE. "AREN'T YOU TIRED OF LIVING LIKE THIS?". BUT I TOOK IT AS A DIFFERENT APPROACH, IN A WAY THAT THE GIRL ASKS YOU, "AREN'T YOU TIRED OF BEING GOOD?".
