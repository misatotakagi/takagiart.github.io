	MEDIUM: PHOTOSHOP, AUDACITY
<br>
<br>
	THIS PIECE IS ALSO INSPIRED BY GLITCH ART MADE BY AUDACITY, HOWEVER IN THIS CASE, I PERSONALLY HAD MORE CONTROL OF WHAT IT COMES OUT TO BE. ON PHOTOSHOP, I COMBINED A PICTURE OF A MALE MARBLE SCULPTURE WITH AN VIDEO EFFECT FILTER TO MAKE IT TECHNOLOGICAL AND MODERN. THEN I PROCESSED THE IMAGE INTO AUDACITY AND PLAYED WITH THE EFFECTS. FINALLY I PUT THE RAW DATA INTO PHOTOSHOP AND ADDED FURTHER MORE EFFECTS ANF FILTERS. THE TITLE OF THIS PIECE WAS INSPIRED BY THE SCULPTURE'S BELITTLING POSE. MOST MALE STATUES ARE MADE IN INTENTIONS OF IT LOOKING MASCULINE AND STRONG. HOWEVER, IN THIS STATUE, THE AUDIENCE CAN OBSERVE ITS MISERABLE, SYMPATHETIC AURA.
