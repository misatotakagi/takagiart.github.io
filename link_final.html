	MEDIUM: CLIP STUDIO PAINT, PHOTOSHOP, AUDACITY
<br>
<br>
	THIS PIECE WAS DONE BY CLIP STUDIO PAINT AND EDITED BY PHOTOSHOP. THEN AUDACITY WAS USED TO ADD THE GLITCH EFFECT. THE GLITCH EFFECT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS I HAVE LEARNED IN THIS CLASS BECAUSE OF HOW EASY IT IS, AND HOW USEFUL IT IS. IT’S USUALLY NOT THAT EASY TO ADD A GLITCHING EFFECT UNLESS YOU LAYER BUNCH OF TRANSPARENT “GLITCH-LIKE” PICTURES FOUND ONLINE. HOWEVER, AUDACITY HAS MADE IT MUCH EASIER FOR ARTISTS TO EXPLORE NEW MEDIUMS AND JUST HAVE FUN WITH THE PIECE IN GENERAL. IN MY ORIGINAL ARTWORK, IT WAS JUST A BLACK AND WHITE ILLUSTRATION OF THE FEMALE, INSPIRED BY ITO JUNJI. IT STUCK TO THE ORIGINAL MANGA-LIKE CHARACTERISTIC OF FLAT ELEMENTS. IT WAS ONE EXPRESSION, NOT MUCH YOU CAN INTERPRET OUT OF THE IMAGE. HOWEVER, BY ADDING COLORS AND TEXTS ON PHOTOSHOP, I WAS ABLE TO ADD MOOD TO THE IMAGE. THE PURPLE AND PINK COLORS ADDS MORE MYSTERIOUS AND FEMININE ELEMENTS TO THE DRAWING, AND THE TEXTS, WHEN TRANSLATED, SAYS “DISGUSTING” AND “DON’T TALK TO ME”, WHICH DESCRIBES HER EXPRESSION. ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO IN MY DIGITAL ARTWORKS IS TO ADD JAPANESE TEXTS, NOT BECAUSE JAPANESE TEXTS SEEM “AESTHETIC” TO SOME, BUT BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME OF WHO I AM AS A JAPANESE ARTIST. LIVING IN AMERICA HAS MADE ME FORGET SOME PHRASES FROM TIME TO TIME, SO THIS WAY I AM KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH MY LANGUAGE, AS WELL AS MY SELF IDENTITY. ONE OF THE HARDSHIPS I HAVE FACED IN THIS ARTWORK WAS THE GLITCH EFFECT. CONVERTING THE IMAGE FROM JPG FILE TO BMP, THEN RAW, THEN CONVERTING IT BACK INTO PHOTOSHOP WAS A STRUGGLE. I HAVE SPENT MANY HOURS TRYING TO SOLVE THE ERROR THAT SAYS “FILE NOT SUPPORTED”. ALTHOUGH I HAVE SAID IT IS AN EASY WAY TO ADD GLITCH EFFECTS, IT IS NONETHELESS STRESSFUL. HOWEVER, I DO LIKE THE WAY IT CAME OUT. USING AUDACITY IS SO UNPREDICTABLE, IT’S LUCKY IF YOU FIND SOMETHING YOU LIKE. I DO BELIEVE THAT I HAVE BECOME BETTER AT USING PHOTOSHOP. IN THE BEGINNING, MAKING A MEME WITH CUTTING OUT THE BACKGROUND WAS SUCH A STRUGGLE FOR ME. PHOTOSHOP SEEMED SO BUSY AND COMPLEX, BUT NOW I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE TO PLAY AROUND WITH. AS FOR MY OWN ART SKILL, I HAVE STOPPED BEING SO PRECISE AND WORRIED AND STARTED LETTING THE SOFTWARE DO ITS THING. DIGITAL MEDIA IS SO UNPREDICTABLE, IT IS ALMOST HARD TO MAKE IT DO WHAT YOU WANT WITHOUT RUNNING INTO A PROBLEM. FROM MAKING THIS PROJECT, I HAVE LEARNED THAT I DON’T ALWAYS HAVE TO STAY TWO-DIMENSIONAL WITH MY DRAWINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS ILLUSTRATION WAS JUST BLACK AND WHITE BUT WITH THE HELP OF DIGITAL MEDIA, I WAS ABLE TO ADD COLOR AND TEXTURE, WHICH MADE THE PIECE LOOK MUCH BETTER AND THOUGHT OUT. WITH THIS IN MIND. IM HOPING TO KEEP USING PHOTOSHOP AS ONE OF MY TRUSTY MEDIA, AND RELY MORE ON COMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR TOUCH UPS AND TEXTURES. I AM ALSO HOPING TO COMPLETELY MASTER THE USE OF PHOTOSHOP, ILLUSTRATOR AND AFTER EFFECTS.
