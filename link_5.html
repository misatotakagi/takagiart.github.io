	INITIALLY WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS ILLUSTRATION IS THE VIBRANT, RED HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FIGURE. AT FIRST SHE WAS BASED ON MUTED SOLID COLORS. HOWEVER LATER ON I IMPULSIVELY ADDED HIGHLIGHTS HERE AND THERE, WHICH AUTOMATICALLY CREATED DIMENSION ON THE GIRL. ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVED DOING IN THIS PIECE WAS ADDING RED TINTS THROUGHOUT AND CUTTING IT BACK WITH BRIGHT HIGHLIGHTS. THROUGHOUT MY ARTWORKS, ONE OF THE COMMON THEME IS INTENSE USE OF BLUSH AND HIGHLIGHT. I RELATE THIS TO MY OWN PERSONAL MAKEUP, WHERE YOU CAN SEE ME DROWN MYSELF IN BLUSH AND TOP IT OFF WITH A HIGHLIGHT. I DON'T KNOW IF I GET INSPIRED BY MY ARTWORKS OR IF MY ART IS INSPIRED BY ME.
