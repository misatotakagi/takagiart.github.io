	THIS ART STYLE OF "GLITCH ART" WAS SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW AND FOREIGN FOR ME, AS I HAVE STUCK WITH TRADITIONAL TWO-DIMENTIONAL ART. GLITCH ART HAS BEEN GAINING ATTENTION IN THESE RECENT YEARS WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. CONSIDER THIS AS DIGITAL MEDIA ART OUTSIDE OF THE BOX. THE PROCESS OF THIS ART PIECE WAS FAIRLY EASY, HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME WAS COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE AND UNCONTROLLABLE. FIRST, PHOTOSHOP WAS USED TO CREATE AN COLLAGE IMAGE OF TOM NOOK AND THE WORD "MONEY" IN JAPANESE. TO GIVE A BACKGROUND, TOM NOOK IS A CHARACTER FROM A GAME "ANIMAL CROSSING" AND HE IS FAMOUS FOR MAKING THE PLAYER WORK FOR MONEY. HE IS KNOWN AS THE MONEY RACOON. HENSE THE MONEY BACK THAT HE IS HOLDING AND THE PHRASE "MONEY".
