	MEDIUM: CLIP STUDIO PAINT
<br>
<br>
	ONE OF THE FAVORITE FEATURES CLIP STUDIO PAINT HAS IS THAT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ENDLESS FREE BRUSHES. THIS PIECE WAS DONE WITH A BRUSH THAT CREATES CRAYON-LIKE CONSISTENSY. I ALSO WANTED THIS PIECE TO REMAIN SIMPLE, YET ATTRACTIVE TO THE EYE. THE COLORS USED ARE SO BOLD IN TERMS OF THE BLACK HAIR AND RED LIPS CATCHING YOUR ATTENTION AT FIRST GLANCE. LATELY I HAVE BEEN INTRIGUED BY THE DEVIL HORN AND HOW AESTHETICALLY PLEASING IT IS TO GIVE A HUMAN GIRL A DEMONIC FEATURE. I FEEL LIKE MOST OF MY ILLUSTRATIONS REVOLVE AROUND A DARK, MYSTERIOUS THEME WITH SAD GIRLS, SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS PIECE IS A REALLY GREAT WAY FOR ME TO SUM UP MY ARTISTIC STYLE.
