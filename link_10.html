	THIS PIECE WAS INSPIRED BY TOMIE, A MANGA CHARACTER CREATED BY JUNJI ITO. I PERSONALLY LOVE HIS WORK AND HOW DETAILED YET SIMPLE HIS DESIGNS ARE. I TOOK TOMIE AND RECREATED IT BASED ON MY OWN ARTSTYLE. IT WAS VERY FUN TO PLAY WITH THIN PEN LINES AND INCORPORATE MANGA-LIKE CHARACTERISTICS. ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO DO IN THE FUTURE IS TO ADD ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC OF JUNJI ITO'S WORK, WHICH IS GROTESQUENESS. I FEEL LIKE MOST ARTWORKS, ESPECIALLY IN THE MANGA COMMUNITY LACK GRUESOME FACTORS WHEN IT COMES TO FEMALE CHARACTERS, SO I'M HOPING TO SEE MORE OF THOSE.
