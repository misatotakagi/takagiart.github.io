	THE MAKING OF PIECE IS ACTUALLY A BLUR IN MY MEMORY. TO GIVE A BACKGROUND AS TO WHY, I WAS AWAKE FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY-SIX HOURS THAT DAY WHEN I WAS WORKING ON THIS, AND MY BRAIN REACHED THE CAPACITY WHERE I STARTED DAY DREAMING. HOWEVER, APPARENTLY MY HANDS WERE STILL MOVING BECAUSE WHEN I WOKE UP, THE ILLUSTRATION WAS FULLY COLORED. THIS PIECE WILL FOREVER HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART BECAUSE OF THIS REASON. AS FOR THE WORK ITSELF, I WAS INSPIRED BY FEMININE FRIENDSHIPS. I HAVE ALWAYS ADMIRED FRIENDS (ESPECIALLY GIRLS) WHO WERE EXTREMELY CLOSE WITH EACH OTHER AS IF THEY WERE SISTERS. THE TITLE COMES FROM A TEXT THAT I HAVE RECIEVED FROM MY FRIEND WHEN I WAS IN A DARK PLACE.
